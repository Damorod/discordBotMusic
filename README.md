# Discord Bot

###  Project 

There is a lot of discord bots that play music but the one we used to use on our friends server forced you to pay in order to make youtube autoplay work, so i tried to make one on my own 

### How it works 

The bot has difrentes commands, it works like any other bot, it can play spotify playlist and youtube playlist, but the importante part is that when you search a song individually 
it will automatically add between 8 an 10 songs related to the one you searched and when that queue is ending it will add continually songs.
The only problem is that the youtube api has a limit of search a day, however since we only use it in our server we usually never reach that limit and it works like i wanted to
